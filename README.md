The purpose of this editor is to be able to **run code while Garry's Mod is running**, on every realm (client, server, shared, etc...).

*Note: You can couple the editor with [luadev](https://github.com/Metastruct/luadev) for even more convenient debuging sessions!*
*Note 2: This editor will only work on the **x64** and **chromium** branches of gmod*

Here's a preview of what the editor looks like.
